# HyperMedia-part-1

1.1 User persona:

In this case, it is oriented to the human resources professionals or companies seeking to hire new employees who fit their needs. For this reason, I tried to keep it simple and easy, as these users tend to have limited time.

1.2 Information Architecture: 

In first place, I've decided to write the name as a a large, clear header, followed by the contact and relevant info (E-mail direct link, phone Number, degree), to make it as reachable as possible. 

Then, I added my photo to make the website feel more personal and human. Below that, I organised in different card blocks the profile (my personality, how I approach new experiencies...), languages (including certified titles for each), and other hobbies and personal interests as scuba diving, contact sports (MMA, Kickboxing...), climbing and more. This organised format allows visitors to quickly see the details they are looking for.

Finally, I've included the Education and Job Experience sections at the other side of the layout. They contain a bit more detailed information that visitors can explore once they are interested. This information is such as the beginning and ending years, the place, company or education center name and a little description about the tasks performed, responsibilities held, or achievements accomplished. This part tries to not be very extensive but explaining the necessary info in order to give the visitor a clear idea of my background.

1.3 Visual Design:  

I've decided to go for a more minimalist design, focusing on clarity, usability and simplicity. As it's a formal document, I opted for neutral colors such as dark and light gray combined with white. This color palette helps maintain a clean and elegant appearance, making the content easy to read while giving a sense of professionalism.
To help visitors quickly find what they need, I used bold text to highlight essential details such as section titles, job positions, and skills. I've also incorporated icons to achieve a more modern look.

In addition, I used icons looking for a more visual layout. Plus, I went for big fonts, especially the headers and the contact info for clearer divisions and to help the reader always understand which section is viewing.

The layout is organized in a balanced way, with personal details placed on the left and professional experience and education on the right. This structure guides the reader naturally through the content.

Overall, I aimed to create a balanced composition that reflects professionalism and approachability at the same time, ensuring an easy understanding.
